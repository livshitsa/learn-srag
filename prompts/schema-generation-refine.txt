You are a data schema expert. Your task is to refine an existing JSON Schema based on sample questions that need to be answered using the structured data.

## Task

You are given:
1. A current JSON Schema
2. Sample documents from the corpus
3. Sample questions that users want to answer

Your goal is to refine the schema to ensure it captures the attributes needed to answer the sample questions while maintaining consistency with the documents.

## Current Schema

{current_schema}

## Sample Documents

{documents}

## Sample Questions

{questions}

## Refinement Guidelines

1. **Analyze the Questions**: For each question, identify what attributes or information would be needed to answer it
2. **Add Missing Attributes**: If the current schema is missing attributes that would help answer the questions, add them
3. **Remove Irrelevant Attributes**: If some attributes in the current schema don't appear in the documents or aren't useful for the questions, consider removing them
4. **Refine Descriptions**: Improve descriptions to be more precise and helpful for query generation
5. **Update Examples**: Ensure examples are accurate and representative of the data in the documents
6. **Maintain Types**: Keep the same data types unless there's a clear error
7. **Keep It Flat**: Continue to use only primitive types - no nested objects or arrays

## Schema Requirements (Must Follow)

1. **Top-level structure:**
   - Must include "title" (string): A descriptive name for the schema
   - Must include "description" (string): Brief description of what the schema represents
   - Must include "type" (string): Must be "object"
   - Must include "properties" (object): Object containing all attributes
   - Must include "required" (array): List of required property names

2. **Property requirements:**
   Each property in "properties" MUST have:
   - "type" (string): One of: "string", "number", "integer", "boolean"
   - "description" (string): Clear explanation of what this attribute represents
   - "examples" (array): At least 2-3 example values from the documents

3. **Type constraints:**
   - Only use primitive types: "string", "number", "integer", "boolean"
   - DO NOT use nested objects or arrays
   - DO NOT use "object" or "array" types for properties
   - Use "integer" for whole numbers, "number" for decimals
   - Use "string" for text, dates, and categorical values
   - Use "boolean" for yes/no or true/false values

4. **Attribute selection:**
   - Focus on attributes that would help answer the sample questions
   - Keep attributes that appear in multiple documents
   - Avoid attributes that are too specific to individual documents
   - Avoid lengthy text fields (like full descriptions or long narratives)
   - Include attributes useful for filtering, aggregation, and comparison
   - Prefer quantifiable attributes (numbers, dates, categories)

## Schema Format

Return ONLY a valid JSON Schema in the following format (no additional text):

```json
{
  "title": "Descriptive Title",
  "description": "Brief description of what this schema represents",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "property_name": {
      "type": "string|number|integer|boolean",
      "description": "Clear description of this property",
      "examples": ["example1", "example2", "example3"]
    }
  },
  "required": ["property1", "property2"]
}
```

## Instructions

1. Review the current schema
2. Analyze the sample questions to identify what attributes are needed
3. Check if the documents contain information to populate those attributes
4. Refine the schema by adding, removing, or modifying properties
5. Ensure all constraints above are followed
6. Return ONLY the refined JSON Schema - no additional explanation or commentary
