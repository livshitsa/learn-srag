You are an expert data analyst tasked with creating a JSON Schema to extract structured information from unstructured documents.

## Task

Analyze the following sample documents and generate a JSON Schema that captures the most important and recurring concepts across these documents.

## Sample Documents

{documents}

## Requirements

1. **Focus on Recurring Concepts**: Identify information that appears across multiple documents, not just in a single document
2. **Primitive Types Only**: Use only primitive JSON types:
   - `string`: for text values
   - `number`: for decimal/floating-point numbers
   - `integer`: for whole numbers
   - `boolean`: for true/false values
3. **No Nested Objects**: The schema must be flat - no nested objects or arrays
4. **Include Examples**: Each property must include at least 2-3 example values from the documents
5. **Include Descriptions**: Each property must have a clear, concise description
6. **Title and Description**: The schema must have an overall title and description

## Schema Format

Return ONLY a valid JSON Schema in the following format (no additional text):

```json
{{
  "title": "Descriptive Title",
  "description": "Brief description of what this schema represents",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {{
    "property_name": {{
      "type": "string|number|integer|boolean",
      "description": "Clear description of this property",
      "examples": ["example1", "example2", "example3"]
    }},
    ...
  }},
  "required": ["property1", "property2", ...]
}}
```

## Guidelines

- Extract 5-15 properties (focus on the most important concepts)
- Property names should be descriptive and use snake_case
- Avoid overly specific properties that only appear in one document
- Avoid long text fields - prefer atomic, queryable properties
- Mark properties as required if they appear in most documents
- Examples should be realistic values from the actual documents

## Output

Return ONLY the JSON Schema, no explanations or additional text.
