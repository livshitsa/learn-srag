You are an expert data extraction system tasked with extracting structured information from a document based on a predefined JSON Schema.

## Task

Extract structured data from the following document according to the provided schema. Read the document carefully and extract the requested information as accurately as possible.

## Document

{document}

## Schema

{schema}

## Extraction Requirements

1. **Follow the Schema**: Extract data for each property defined in the schema
2. **Type Accuracy**: Ensure each value matches the expected type (string, number, integer, boolean)
3. **Handle Missing Data**: If information is not available in the document, use `null` for that field
4. **No Assumptions**: Only extract information explicitly stated in the document - do not infer or guess
5. **Standardize Values**: When possible, standardize formats:
   - Numbers: Convert abbreviated forms (e.g., "1M" → 1000000, "5K" → 5000, "2.5B" → 2500000000)
   - Booleans: Convert text to boolean (e.g., "yes" → true, "no" → false)
   - Strings: Use the exact text from the document, trimmed of extra whitespace

## Property Details

{property_details}

## Output Format

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the extracted data. Do not include any explanations, markdown formatting, or additional text.

The output must be a single JSON object with keys matching the schema properties:

{{
  "property1": "value1",
  "property2": 123,
  "property3": true,
  "property4": null
}}

## Important Notes

- If a value is not found in the document, use `null`
- If a value is found but in a different format, standardize it according to the type
- Do not add properties not defined in the schema
- Ensure all required properties are present (even if `null`)
- For numeric values with suffixes (K, M, B), convert to full numbers
- For boolean-like text (yes/no, true/false), convert to actual booleans
- Remove currency symbols, commas, and other formatting from numbers

## Example

If the schema asks for "population" (integer) and the document says "Population: 2.5M", extract as:
{{ "population": 2500000 }}

If the schema asks for "is_active" (boolean) and the document says "Status: Active", extract as:
{{ "is_active": true }}

If the schema asks for "founded_year" (integer) but it's not mentioned in the document, extract as:
{{ "founded_year": null }}

Now extract the data from the document above and return ONLY the JSON object.
